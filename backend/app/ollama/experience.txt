Pierre Tran is a highly accomplished computer scientist with a robust background in software engineering, research, and leadership. He earned both his M.Eng. and B.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, with a concentration in AI/ML and a minor in Mathematics, achieving a stellar GPA of 4.0.

At Capital One in McLean, VA, Pierre served as a Software Engineering Intern from May 2024 to August 2024. In this role, he designed and implemented a multi-modal NLP model that provided real-time suggestions for ambiguity, grammatical, and complexity errors in the Enterprise-Wide Requirements Catalog, reaching an accuracy of 86.5%. He further enhanced the user experience by integrating a FastAPI backend with a proprietary model and the Catalog-UI. Additionally, Pierre configured a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline and deployed the solution to AWS serverless infrastructure, achieving an impressive 150% build-time optimization.

During his internship at Zeta Associates in Fairfax, VA from May 2023 to August 2023, Pierre was instrumental in designing and developing a full-stack Digital Signal Processing application tailored for real-time streaming. His work involved leveraging technologies such as Next.js, Redpanda (Kafka), Cassandra, and Python to process raw IQ data using FFTs. Pierre also developed an RNN-LSTM machine learning classification API that could determine the genre of a song from raw bytes with 75% accuracy. His role extended to researching and deploying the application with a resilient design using Karmada for multi-cluster failover, ensuring high availability and robust performance.

At Obscurity Labs in Ashburn, VA, where he interned from June 2022 to August 2022, Pierre developed a comprehensive cybersecurity tool using a suite of modern technologies including Python, MongoDB, FastAPI, and React. He created a command-line interface (CLI) application capable of extracting extensive Windows OS metadata in under two minutes. By connecting the CLI, API, and database, he delivered a seamless full-stack application that enabled complete querying and input capabilities, demonstrating his strong full-stack development skills.

In his academic career, Pierre has also taken on roles that underscore his commitment to knowledge sharing and research. As an Undergraduate Teacher Assistant for CS 3744 – Introduction to GUI Programming and Graphics in Blacksburg, VA (August 2023 – May 2024), he coordinated office hours and provided crucial guidance to students working with React, D3, and full-stack technologies. Moreover, as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Computer Science – Theory and Algorithms (August 2022 – May 2023), Pierre collaborated closely with a team of graduate researchers led by Dr. Bo Ji. His contributions included implementing online and augmented learning algorithms (Primal-Dual) to further research in Age of Information, analyzing performance metrics and algorithms, and summarizing his findings in detailed weekly reports.

Beyond his internships and academic roles, Pierre has demonstrated significant initiative and leadership through various projects and organizational roles. He achieved third place overall at HackViolet in February 2024 with his innovative project "My Digital Wardrobe," which utilized OpenCV to track a person and display custom clothing in real time via a projector. The project also featured a full-stack application built with React, Express, Flask, and MongoDB that enabled users to design and visualize clothing. As the Webmaster and Committee Lead/Board Member for SASE from May 2023 to May 2024, he spearheaded the design and development of a new organization website using modern tools such as React, Vite.js, Tailwind, and Bun, while managing a team of 11 undergraduate developers using agile methodologies.

Pierre’s technical expertise spans a broad array of programming languages and technologies, including Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash, C, and Go, along with proficiency in Git, Linux, FastAPI, MongoDB, React, Vue, D3, Express, Docker, REST APIs, Agile practices, Next.js, Flask, Cassandra, Redpanda (Kafka), Druid, DSP, YAML, Kubernetes, Karmada, MUI, Vite.js, machine learning, AWS, and Jenkins. His dedication to excellence is further evidenced by his 14 individual Science Olympiad Medals, three KDF Diamond Scholarships, and consistent recognition on the Dean’s List on four occasions.
