To convert an XML file into HTML, follow these steps:

1. **Parse the XML**: Use an XML parser to read the provided XML document.

2. **Extract Tags**: Identify and extract all the tags from the XML.

3. **Map Element Names**: Map each element name extracted from XML to its corresponding HTML tag using a predefined mapping strategy if necessary.

4. **Reconstruct HTML Structure**: Rebuild the HTML structure by converting each XML element into its HTML counterpart, maintaining proper nesting and indentation.

5. **Handle DOCTYPE**: Convert the DOCTYPE declaration appropriately from XHTML 1.0 Transitional to standard HTML 5.

6. **Add Metadata**: Include any necessary metadata (like a title) if present in the XML.

7. **Generate Output**: Combine all the parsed elements and converted parts into a well-structured HTML document.

8. **Validate and Test**: Validate the generated HTML against both XML and HTML standards, and test it to ensure proper rendering in web browsers.

By following these steps, you can accurately convert an XML file into a standard HTML document that is compatible with web browsers.
